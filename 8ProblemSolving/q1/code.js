 * @example
 * longestSubstringWithoutRepeats('abcabcbb'); // 3

 * @explanation
 * For the first example, the longest substring without repeating characters is 'abc', which has a length of 3.
 * For the second example, the longest substring without repeating characters is 'b', which has a length of 1.
